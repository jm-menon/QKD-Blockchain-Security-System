# QKD-Blockchain-Security-System
This is a project that simulates a Data encryption and storage process.
For Data encryption I have used a Quantum Key Distribution System (QKD) to generate keys for AES to make the entire process of encryption unbreakable even by quantum computers.
Storage of Data has been on a Blockchain based system will ensure safe, tamper proof and transperant storage of data.
Since we store the encrypted hashes only on the blockchain data deletion can be made possible by introducing a system to map nullified data with its corresponding hash within the blockchain.
This ofcourse will also ensure data masking within the blockchain.
